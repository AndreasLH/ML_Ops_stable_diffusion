# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

### Week 1

* [ ] Create a git repository
* [ ] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
* [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code
* [ ] Setup version control for your data or part of your data
* [ ] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code
* [ ] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
* [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
* [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
* [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if
      you can optimize your code
* [ ] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code. Additionally,
      consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep.
* [ ] Use Pytorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code

### Week 2

* [ ] Write unit tests related to the data part of your code
* [ ] Write unit tests related to model construction and or model training
* [ ] Calculate the coverage.
* [ ] Get some continuous integration running on the github repository
* [ ] Create a data storage in GCP Bucket for you data and preferable link this with your data version control setup
* [ ] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images
* [ ] Get your model training in GCP using either the Engine or Vertex AI
* [ ] Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using your model
* [ ] If applicable, consider deploying the model locally using torchserve
* [ ] Deploy your model in GCP using either Functions or Run as the backend

### Week 3

* [ ] Check how robust your model is towards data drifting
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the system telemetry of your deployed model
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the performance of your deployed model
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed data loading
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed model training
* [ ] Play around with quantization, compilation and pruning for you trained models to increase inference speed

### Additional

* [ ] Revisit your initial project description. Did the project turn out as you wanted?
